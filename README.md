# Build with Stacks and Shapes

This SwiftUI code originates from the Apple Developer website's "Build with Stacks and Shapes" project. The project demonstrates how to use SwiftUI's powerful drawing capabilities to create a visually appealing composition of colorful shapes.

## Code Explanation

The `ContentView` struct is the main view of the app and handles the UI components of the colorful shapes composition. It includes the following key components:

1.  `ZStack`: The `ZStack` allows you to layer multiple views on top of each other. In this case, it's used to stack different shapes and apply opacity to the background color.

2.  `Color.yellow.opacity(0.3)`: A yellow color view with 30% opacity. It acts as the background for the composition, providing a slightly transparent yellow overlay.

3.  `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 200)`: A rounded rectangle shape with a corner radius of 200. It is the largest shape in the composition and serves as a canvas for other elements.

4.  `Rectangle()`: A rectangle shape used as a vertical bar that extends from the bottom of the rounded rectangle.

5.  `Capsule()`: A capsule shape that appears like an oval and is horizontally centered on the rounded rectangle. It is colored brown with a shadow applied to it.

6.  `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 70)`: Another rounded rectangle shape, smaller in size and colored indigo. It appears at the bottom of the composition.

7.  `Circle()`: A circle shape that has been trimmed to only show its upper half. It is placed at the top center of the composition.

## Preview

The `ContentView` displays the colorful composition, consisting of various shapes and colors. The yellow background with opacity creates a subtle visual effect, while the different shapes add artistic flair to the layout.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to create your own artistic compositions with SwiftUI!
